  abstract = {Although Jordan has applied lockdown in response to COVID-19 pandemic, many people were not adherent to the quarantine. We aimed to examine the attitudes of the Jordanians and how these attitudes can predict their adherence using the health belief model (HBM). A cross-sectional study of 5057 participants using an internet-based questionnaire was conducted during lockdown. Multivariable ordinal regression analyses were used to estimate predictors of adherence to home quarantine. Overall, 646 (12.8\%), 2078 (41.2\%), and 2317 (46\%) of participants showed poor, intermediate, and strict adherence, respectively. Of the HBM constructs, seriousness ({$\beta$}= 0.116, 95\% CI 0.027 to 0.205), benefits ({$\beta$}= 0.056, 95\% CI 0.002 to 0.110) and barriers ({$\beta$}= -0.025, 95\% CI -0.035 to -0.015) were significant predictors. We identified income insecurity ({$\beta$}= -0.096, 95\% CI -0.144 to -0.046), social withdrawal ({$\beta$}= -0.062, 95\% CI -0.121 to -0.004), religious concerns ({$\beta$}= -0.149, 95\% CI -0.202 to -0.096) and health consequences ({$\beta$}= 0.065, 95\% CI 0.011 to 0.11) as barriers. Governmental instructions were the only predictive external cue ({$\beta$}= 0.055, 95\% CI 0.004 to 0.014). Our findings suggest that a high number of Jordanians are adherent with the quarantine, demonstrating the ability of governmental policies in tackling potential barriers.},

Design/methodology/approach The data are collected through an online survey. Factors derived from grounded theories and models such as affordance theory and Hofstede's cultural framework were considered. Spearman correlation and nonparametric analysis were used to test the hypotheses. Findings The results revealed that social media usage was positively associated with healing and affiliation, and negatively associated with self-control. There are also positive associations between social media usage and sharing information related to COVID-19 without verification, perceived reliability of COVID-19 information on social media and relapse. The impact of demographic and cultural factors indicated significant effects of gender, age, marital status, educational level, power distance and collectivism on social media usage, sharing information, perceived information reliability, healing and affiliation. Originality/value This study contributes to technology affordances by examining social media's positive and negative affordances in a new context (COVID-19 pandemic). From the positive side, this study explores the use of social media for healing and affiliation. As for the negative impact of social media during the pandemic, this study assesses the user's addiction to social media use (relapse) and perception of the social media information reliability and information sharing without verification. It is among few research endeavors conducted in a non-Western country. This study also examines the influence of demographic and cultural factors on social media users. The results provide insights for both researchers and policymakers regarding social media usage.},

This study was a cross-sectional survey in which we used the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and the General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7). Also, we examined the students' perceptions of their academic performance using the Academic Self-Concept Scale (ASCS). A total of 610 students responded to the survey. The average score on the Academic Self-Concept Scale was 2.76\,{$\pm$}\,0.35, the students presented a risk of 61.5\% for possible depressive disorder and 52.1\% for possible generalized anxiety disorder. The intensity of depression and anxiety symptoms had a significant effect on Academic Self-Concept Scale scores (p\,{$<$}\,0.001 and p\,{$<$}\,0.05, respectively).

  abstract = {Background: Recent studies suggest social media may be an attractive strategy to promote mental health and wellness. There remains a need to examine the utility for individually tailored wellness messages posted to social media sites such as Facebook to facilitate positive psychological outcomes. Objective: Our aim was to extend the growing body of evidence supporting the potential for social media to enhance mental health. We evaluated the influence of an 8-week social media intervention on anxiety in college students and examined the impact of dynamic (active) versus static (passive) Facebook content on physical activity behaviors. Methods: Participants in the static group (n=21) accessed a Facebook page featuring 96 statuses. Statuses were intended to engage cognitive processes followed by behavioral processes of change per the transtheoretical model of behavior change. Content posted on the static Facebook page was identical to the dynamic page; however, the static group viewed all 96 statuses on the first day of the study, while the dynamic group received only 1 to 2 of these status updates per day throughout the intervention. Anxiety was measured using the Overall Anxiety Severity and Impairment Scale (OASIS). Time spent engaging in physical activity was assessed using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). Results: The OASIS change score for the dynamic Facebook group was statistically significant (P=.003), whereas the change score for the static group was not (P=.48). A statistically significant group-by-time interaction was observed (P=.03). The total IPAQ group-by-time interaction was not statistically significant (P=.06). Conclusions: We observed a decrease in anxiety and increase in total physical activity for the dynamic group only. Dynamic social networking sites, featuring regularly updated content, may be more advantageous than websites that retain static content over time.

This begs the question, what is the relationship between social media use and college student mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic? Recent Findings Prior studies have found mixed results regarding the relationship between social media use and college student mental health. This relationship has become increasingly complex during the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that excessive or problematic social media use during the COVID-19 pandemic was correlated with worse mental health outcomes that could be mitigated by dialectical thinking, optimism, mindfulness, and cognitive reappraisal. Summary The COVID-19 pandemic acts as a moderator by strengthening the relationship between social media use and mental health. Future studies should consider the impact of social media on college student mental health and concentrate on intervention initiatives to ensure the psychological well-being of college students during a global pandemic outbreak.},

In Study 2, we developed and tested a two-stage self-help intervention program. We recruited a sample of college students (N = 38) who met criteria for social media addiction to receive the intervention. Results showed that the intervention was effective in reducing the students' social media addiction and improving their mental health and academic efficiency.

Life satisfaction and self-esteem are commonly used to represent well-being, while depression and loneliness are usually used to indicate distress. The mean correlations of problematic SM use with life satisfaction and self-esteem are small, whereas those of problematic SM use with depression and loneliness are moderate. The moderating effects of publication status, instruments, platforms and mean age are not significant.Conclusions:The magnitude of the correlations between problematic SM use and mental health indicators can generalize across most moderator conditions.},

Some studies have cited statistically significant associations between adolescent social media use and depression and have proposed that parents must regulate their adolescents' social media use in order to protect their mental health. Method In order to rigorously assess the size of the effect that has been reported in the current scientific literature, we conducted a meta-analysis of studies that measured the association between social media use specifically and depressive symptoms amongst early- to mid- adolescents (11-18 years-old). We searched Psychnet, PubMed, and Web of Science with the following terms: online social networks, social media, internet usage, facebook, twitter, instagram, myspace, snapchat, and depression. Results We found a small but significant positive correlation (k=12 studies, r=.11, p{$<$}.01) between adolescent social media use and depressive symptoms. There was also high heterogeneity (I2=95.22\%) indicating substantial variation among studies. Conclusions High heterogeneity along with the small overall effect size observed in the relationship between self-reported social media use and depressive symptoms suggests that other factors are likely to act as significant moderators of the relationship. We suggest that future research should be focused on understanding which types of use may be harmful (or helpful) to mental health, rather than focusing on overall use measures that likely reflect highly heterogeneous exposures.},

This study aimed to examine the possible mediating role of psychological capital and the moderating role of academic burnout in the relationship between problematic social media usage and anxiety among university students during COVID-19. A total of 3,123 undergraduates from universities in Shanghai participated in an online survey from March to April 2020. The results showed that problematic social media usage among university students predicted their levels of anxiety. Mediation analysis indicated that psychological capital mediated the relationship between problematic social media usage and anxiety. Furthermore, for university students whose academic performance had been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, the effects of both problematic social media usage and the psychological capital on anxiety were moderated by academic burnout. For university students whose academic performance was not affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, academic burnout moderated the effects of psychological capital but not the effects of problematic social media usage on anxiety. The results highlighted the underlying mechanisms in the relationship between problematic social media usage and anxiety. These findings provide practical insights into the development and implementation of psychological interventions when facing a pandemic.},

The Responses to Educational Disruption Survey (REDS) investigated how teaching and learning were affected by the health crisis, and how education stakeholders responded to the educational disruption across and within countries. The study aimed to provide a systemic, multi-perspective, and comparative picture of the situation at the secondary education level (grade eight) in 11 countries spanning Africa, Asia, Arab region, Europe, and Latin America. While many other efforts exist that collect and provide similar information, they are mostly derived from non-representative rapid surveys and lack internationally comparable information from schools, collected in a systematic and scientific manner. The REDS International Report presents unique data, collected from countries, schools, teachers, and students for the first time, in chapters that cover several themes on which data were collected which include student and teacher well-being, students' academic progress during the school closures, and the measures countries have implemented to keep all children learning. Initial findings provide evidence for better orienting and tailoring policy responses to crisis and provide invaluable information on what may be required to accelerate education, recover from crisis, and to strengthen the resilience of education systems in the future.

However, findings regarding social media's impact on young adults' mental health are mixed. There is a need to identify social mechanisms underlying the effect of social media on mental health outcomes. Our study breaks new ground by proposing and testing a moderated mediation pathway from social media use to stress in young adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted a two-wave online panel survey in the context of China. With a general basis of the Street's three-stage model, our results indicated that social media failed to directly affect young adults' stress. Instead, fatalism completely mediated this relationship. Also, one's perceived social media exhaustion negatively moderated this mediation pathway. The findings have significant theoretical and practical implications for the use of social media to promote health, well-being, and quality of life among young people during public health crises.},

As blood supplies are considerably outstripped by the immediate and crucial need of blood transfusions, the recruitment and retention of voluntary qualified donors pose an acute challenge for blood centers. In this regard, digital technology has proven to be effective in the optimization of blood donation in many ways. Based on that fact, it was designed a solution consisting of a hybrid mobile application named `Blood4Life' which employs gamification techniques and integrates the principles of Trans-Theoretical Model (TTM) of behavior change. This paper presents, therefore, the requirements and characteristics of `Blood4Life' which aims at targeting all types of users in terms of their stage of change which defines their readiness and willingness to donate blood. By means of a variety of gamification elements and according to the initial stage of change of the user, the mobile application is likely to trigger the processes of change that are assumed to encourage users to progress towards later stages.},

  abstract = {Online social media is now omnipresent in many people's daily lives. Much research has been conducted on how and why we use social media, but little is known about the impact of social media abstinence. Therefore, we designed an ecological momentary intervention study using smartphones. Participants were instructed not to use social media for 7 days (4 days baseline, 7 days intervention, and 4 days postintervention; N\,=\,152). We assessed affect (positive and negative), boredom, and craving thrice a day (time-contingent sampling), as well as social media usage frequency, usage duration, and social pressure to be on social media at the end of each day (7,000+ single assessments). We found withdrawal symptoms, such as significantly heightened craving ({$\beta$}\,=\,0.10) and boredom ({$\beta$}\,=\,0.12), as well as reduced positive and negative affect (only descriptively). Social pressure to be on social media was significantly heightened during social media abstinence ({$\beta$}\,=\,0.19) and a substantial number of participants (59 percent) relapsed at least once during the intervention phase. We could not find any substantial rebound effect after the end of the intervention. Taken together, communicating through online social media is evidently such an integral part of everyday life that being without it leads to withdrawal symptoms (craving, boredom), relapses, and social pressure to get back on social media.},

  abstract = {The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is likely to enhance the risk of addictive social media use (SMU) as people spend more time online maintaining connectivity when face-to-face communication is limited. Stress is assumed to be a critical predictor of addictive SMU. However, the mechanisms underlying the association between stress and addictive SMU in crises like the current COVID-19 situation remain unclear. The present study aimed to understand the relationship between COVID-19 stress and addictive SMU by examining the mediating role of active use and social media flow (i.e., an intensive, enjoyable experience generated by SMU that perpetuates media use behaviors). A sample of 512 Chinese college students (Mage = 22.12 years, SD = 2.47; 62.5\% women) provided self-report data on COVID-19 stress and SMU variables (i.e., time, active use, flow, addictive behavior) via an online survey from March 24 to April 1, 2020. The results showed that COVID-19 stress was positively associated with tendencies toward addictive SMU. Path analyses revealed that this relationship was significantly serially mediated by active use and social media flow, with SMU time being controlled. Our findings suggest that individuals who experience more COVID-19 stress are at increased risk of addictive SMU that may be fostered by active use and flow experience. Specific attention should be paid to these high-risk populations and future interventions to reduce addictive SMU could consider targeting factors of both active use and social media flow.},
